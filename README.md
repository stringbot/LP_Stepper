## Launchpad Stepper

Max step sequencer for the Novation Launchpad. Requires Max5 or better.

`LP_Stepper.maxpat` is the main patch, `ctl_toggle.maxpat` and `lp_matrix.maxpat` are sub-patchers.

Launch `LP_Stepper.maxpat` and set the "Launchpad" MIDI selector to point at your Launchpad and the "MIDI Output" selector to the instrument you'd like to send notes to. 

Hit the space bar to start the clock, and toggle notes on and off with the Launchpad.

The left and right arrows will page back and forth between the left and right sides of the sequencer grid.

There's a crappy iPhone video of an early version of the patch [here](https://github.com/stringbot/LP_Stepper). Who knows what went wrong with the sync...

Feel free to use this however you want.
